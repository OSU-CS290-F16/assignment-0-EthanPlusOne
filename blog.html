		<h2> The First Assignment </h2>
		<h3> 9/26/2016 </h3>
		<p>
		Our first assignment was pretty easy, which is good because I'm starting off strong by procrastinating until 4:00PM. <br>
		This is all stuff that I have already learned, so I'm hoping that we will begin content new for me in not too long. <br>
		Actually this is stuff I remember from a "Video Profressor" DVD box set I asked my dad to buy me when I was in elementary school. <br>
